# ParseLiveQuery-Android
This project used to understand simple logic of Parse LiveQuery, I am working o it and I didn't found any help.
I spend too many hours to understand, after that when I acheived the results I posted the project on hithub,
so others can get help from this tutorial.

## Setup the Project
* Follow the instructions from official website to configure LiveQuery for your app (I configured my app "Project" class)
* Note down your SERVER URL, App_Id, Client_Id 
* You will get a url for LiveQuery while configururation of LiveQuery on portal. 
* Add all these values to the project MainActivity.class files
* Run the project, Click the button
* Now, open parse table from web and change the "Project" table values, you will be notified in Android Studio "Android Monitor"

If you want contribute to this project, it will be very nice, other may get help from this repository.
